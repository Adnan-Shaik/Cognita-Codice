<p class="text-center">COGNITA CODICE was launched in November 2020 and incorporated as Cognita Codice, Inc. The founder, Shaik Mohammad Adnan, is a Certified Game Developer who took up programming at 14 years of age and created Cognita Codice as a way to streamline a student's progress from beginner to being a job-ready candidate.
In a 2015 podcast interview, he summarized his motivation for creating COGNITA CODICE as follows:<q>
    <em>
COGNITA CODICE is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code. I'm committing my career and the rest of my life towards making this process as efficient and painless as possible. All those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with Cognita Codice.
The original curriculum is focused on HTML/CSS, Javscript, React.JS, and Node.js and was estimated to take 60 hours to complete. Many of the lessons were links to free material on other platforms, such as NetNInja, FreeCodeCamp, or Traversy Media. The course was broken up into “Waypoints” (quick, interactive tutorials), “Ziplines” (front-end projects), and “Basejumps” (full-stack projects). Completing the front-end and full-stack projects awarded the student with respective certificates.
The curriculum was updated in December 2020 to rely less on outside material, remove the unconventional section names, and switch focus from AngularJS to React.js as the front-end library of choice. There were a number of additions to the coursework, including Node.js and CSS, which brought the total time estimate to 80 hours and two more certificates, Front-end, and back-end.</q></em></p>
